Perfectly Splendid is a **Quilt** modpack, that is mainly focused on exploration, combat and creativity, while staying true to vanilla. One could call it a kitchen sink modpack, due to the amount of mods included, However, I do try to keep a certain theme going - expanding on what Minecraft is, without turning it into something it isn't. And yet, it's not exactly what you would call a "Vanilla+" pack, as describing it with just a single plus sign would be a big understatement. You won't see crazy questing, leveling or progression in Perfectly Splendid. Instead, you will find yourself in a familiar world full of life, new challenges and lots of amazing blocks to expand your creativity. If you are bored of vanilla, but don't wish to get yourself into massive modpacks quite yet, and vanilla+ doesn't cut it for you, then give Perfectly Splendid a try.

## üî® Installing the modpack

The pack is possible to install with any launcher, however, I can only fully support 3 methods: Vanilla Launcher; CurseForge app; Prism Launcher.

‚ö† Warning ‚ö† MultiMC users: at the time of writing this, MMC has a bug that prevents Narrator Library from working, breaking text-to-speech blocks from Supplementaries. Otherwise, MultiMC is fully supported, but you will have to use something else to download the mods.

<details><summary>Using Prism Launcher (recommended):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install Prism Launcher https://prismlauncher.org/download/
2. Open Prism Launcher, right click anywhere and choose "Create instance"
3. On the left side panel select "CurseForge", look up Perfectly Splendid and install it

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using CurseForge app (Windows only):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install CurseForge app https://download.curseforge.com/
2. Open the app and let it find your Minecraft installation

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using vanilla launcher (not preferred):</summary>
<p>

4. Navigate to ---, choose the latest version of the pack and scroll down until you see the list of included mods
5. Download every mod, make sure to use the correct versions, and put them all into the mods folder

### ‚ö† Known issues

<details><summary>Mobs added with Geckolib may have broken animations when using shaders.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Reported. Not fixed. 

  **Severity**: Low.

</details>

<details><summary>Creating superflat worlds is not possible.</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Mooshrooms' mushrooms are flashing.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Reported. Not fixed. 

  **Severity**: Medium. 

  **Workarounds**: Open BetterNether mod jar with any archive manager, navigate to ./assets/minecraft/, delete every folder exept optifine and textures, navigate to ./assets/minecraft/textures/ and delete the blocks folder. These are 3D models for mushrooms, that cause flashing on Mooshrooms when used with Sodium. You should check if a texture pack you want to install adds 3D mushrooms, if you decide to add more texture packs to the modpack, and manually remove it as well.

</details>

<details><summary>Tokenable Shulkers have untranslated names in GUI screens.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Reported. Not fixed. 

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Open the mod's jar, navigate to ./assets/tokenablefurnaces/lang and edit the en_us json. All you have to do is copy all the shulkerbox entries, paste them anywhere you want in the file and remove undescores from its names.
