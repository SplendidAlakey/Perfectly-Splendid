## ATTENTION! Unfortunately, due to the way CurseForge currently handles modpacks, I am no longer able to maintain the pack. Prior to recent changes, it was possible to include files from any modloader to the pack, but now it has to be tagged as specifically supported by the modloader in question. Since it would require me to go around over 200 mods and ask people to tag their mods as Quilt-supported, I'm simply no longer going to update the pack until this change is reversed. It's quite disheartening, as I had big plans for the future of the pack, but it's completely unrealistic for me to ask over 200 devs to tag their mods as Quilt-compatible. Thank you everyone, who decided to check out Perfectly Splendid!

## üî® Installing the modpack

The pack is possible to install with any launcher, however, I can only fully support 3 methods: Vanilla Launcher; CurseForge app; Prism Launcher.

‚ö† Warning ‚ö† MultiMC users: at the time of writing this, MMC has a bug, that prevents Narrator Library from working, breaking text-to-speech blocks from Supplementaries. Otherwise, MultiMC is fully supported, but you will have to use something else to download the mods.

<details><summary>Using Prism Launcher (recommended):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install Prism Launcher https://prismlauncher.org/download/
2. Open Prism Launcher, right-click anywhere and choose "Create instance"
3. On the left side panel select "CurseForge", look up Perfectly Splendid and install it

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using CurseForge app (Windows only):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install CurseForge app https://download.curseforge.com/
2. Open the app and let it find your Minecraft installation
3. Navigate to the Minecraft tab, select "Browse modpacks", search for Perfectly Splendid and install it

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using vanilla launcher (not recommended):</summary>
<p>

1. Install the 1.19.2 version of the game and make sure it works without any mods
2. Navigate to https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/ and follow the instructions to install Quilt Loader 0.19.2
3. Navigate to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl and download QSL, then put it into the .minecraft/mods folder. If such a folder doesn't exist, simply create one.
4. Navigate to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/perfectly-splendid, choose the latest version of the pack and scroll down until you see the list of included mods
5. Download every mod, make sure to use the correct versions, and put them all into the mods folder (some mods must be a specific version, to make the process easier find a way to download mods automatically using the pack's zip, rather than manually)
6. Download the modpack file and extract the "config", "defaultconfigs", "shaderpacks" and "kubejs" folders from it, put them all in .minecraft/
7. Launch the game using the Quilt profile in the launcher

<details><summary>Recommended JVM arguments</summary>
<p>

Using my recommendations is not necessary, but it might significantly boost your performance, when generating new chunks and running garbage collection.

The pack was tested on default Java installations shipped with vanilla launcher and CF app, as well as Adoptium JDK 17 and Oracle GraalVM 17.

The pack was tested with default Java arguments provided by vanilla launcher and CF app.

<p> Absolute maximum required allocated memory for the pack is 12GB </p>
<p> 10GB is recommended, if you use Super Duper Vanilla shaders (default). </p>
<p> 8GB is recommended, if you don't use any shaders. </p>
<p> 6-8GB is recommended, if your world is pregenerated or you play on a server. </p>
<p> The recommended memory allocation for servers is 10-12GB. </p>

The lower your RAM, the longer it will take for the game to load and generate chunks!

I highly recommend using Oracle GraalVM as your Minecraft JVM: https://www.graalvm.org/. Using specifically this version significantly speeds up the initial game loading time, as well as chunk generation.

If using Oracle GraalVM - leave JVM flags **empty**! Only set up your RAM usage and you are good to go.
In most other cases, letting JVM do its thing is the best option, as well. However, if you are willing to experiment with different flags, I recommend reading up on all the information in this guide: https://github.com/brucethemoose/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks.

Prism users may also tick "Skip Java compatibility checks", if using any version of Java 17.

</p>
</details>

Apart from choosing the best JVM for your system, you can also try increasing your pagefile size, if you are on Windows and struggling with loading times. I'm using 40GB for other games' modpacks, but you can probably set it to something like 10-15GB for Minecraft.

## ‚ùî If you have more questions before installing I might've already answered some of them [here](https://github.com/SplendidAlakey/Perfectly-Splendid/wiki/F.A.Q.)!

### üìå Known issues

<details><summary>Log Begone is only partially working in Update 6 and above.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Reported.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: None convenient. You'd need to downgrade your Quilt Loader to a version, that works with Log Begone, but I can't guarantee old QL versions will work with the pack anymore.

</details>

<details><summary>The Bumblezone is completely dark, when using shaders.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå The developer is aware.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Simply disable shaders, when travelling there.

</details>

<details><summary>Graveyard Biomes are way too bright with shaders.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Not reported.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Again, just disable shaders, when in those biomes.

</details>

<details><summary>Glass pane culls incorrectly with connected glass pane blocks.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚úÖ Intended.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: You can enable a built-in Continuity resource pack called "glass pane culling fix", however, doing so will break culling for unconnected double stacked glass panes and similar blocks (see Continuity GitHub for pictures).

</details>

<details><summary>Spawn eggs aren't grouped in REI.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚ùå Reported.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Disable Inspecio.

</details>

<details><summary>Sometimes the saving world screen gets stuck.</summary>

  **Status**: üî≥ Not consistently reproducible.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Feel free to just force close the game, if your console logging stopped at "Saving chunks", your world should be fully saved at this point. Or disable C2ME.

</details>

<details><summary>Prism launcher (potentially other 3rd party launchers, too) does not install Quilt loader automatically.</summary>

  **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed in the next version of Prism.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Simply install Quilt loader 0.19.2 yourself.
