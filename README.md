# Perfectly Splendid

Perfectly Splendid is a **Quilt** modpack, that is mainly focused on exploration and creativity, while staying true to vanilla. One could call it a kitchen sink modpack, due to the amount of mods included, However, I do try to keep a certain theme going - expanding on what Minecraft is, without turning it into something it isn't. And yet, it's not exactly what you would call a "Vanilla+" pack, as describing it with just a single plus sign would be a big understatement. You won't see crazy questing, leveling or progression in Perfectly Splendid. Instead, you will find yourself in a familiar world full of life, new challenges and lots of amazing blocks to expand your creativity. If you are bored of vanilla, but don't wish to get yourself into massive modpacks quite yet, and vanilla+ doesn't cut it for you, then give Perfectly Splendid a try.

## What to expect from Perfectly Splendid

--- [screenshots with highlight mods and short descriptions]

## How to install

The pack is possible to install with any launcher, however, I can only fully support 3 methods: Vanilla Launcher; CurseForge app; Prism Launcher.

⚠ Warning ⚠ MultiMC users: at the time of writing this, MMC has a bug that prevents Narrator Library from working, breaking text-to-speech blocks from Supplementaries. Otherwise MultiMC is fully supported, but you will have to use something else to download the mods.

### Using Prism Launcher (recommended):

1. Download and install Prism Launcher https://prismlauncher.org/download/
2. Open Prism Launcher, right click anywhere and choose "Create instance"
3. On the left side panel select "CurseForge", look up Perfectly Splendid and install it

### Using CurseForge app (Windows only):

1. Download and install CurseForge app https://download.curseforge.com/
2. Open the app and let it find your Minecraft installation
3. Navigate to the Minecraft tab, select "Browse modpacks", search for Perfectly Splendid and install it

### Using vanilla launcher (not preferred):

1. Install the 1.19.2 version of the game and make sure it works without any mods
2. Navigate to https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/ and follow the instructions to install Quilt Loader 0.17.5
3. Navigate to https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qvIfYCYJ/versions/1RL57ufH/quilted-fabric-api-4.0.0-beta.17%2B0.64.0-1.19.2.jar and download QSL, then put it into the .minecraft/mods folder. If such folder doesn't exist, simply create one.
4. Navigate to ---, choose the latest version of the pack and scroll down until you see the list of included mods
5. Download every mod, make sure to use the correct versions, and put them all into the mods folder
6. Download the modpack file and exctract the "config", "resourcepacks" and "kubejs" folders from it, put them all in .minecraft/
7. Launch the game using the Quilt profile in the launcher

#### Recommended JVM arguments

Using the recommended flags is not necessary, but it might significantly boost your performance, when generating new chunks and running garbage collection.

The pack was tested on default Java installations shipped with vanilla launcher and CF app, as well as Adoptium JDK 17 and 19.

The pack was tested with default Java arguments provided by vanilla launcher and CF app.
