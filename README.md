Perfectly Splendid is a **Quilt** modpack, that is mainly focused on exploration, combat and creativity, while staying true to vanilla. One could call it a kitchen sink modpack, due to the amount of mods included. However, I do try to keep a certain theme going - expanding on what Minecraft is, without turning it into something it isn't. And yet, it's not exactly what you would call a Vanilla+ pack, as describing it with just a single plus sign would be a big understatement. Perfectly Splendid is not going to guide you by the hand through a completely new game. Instead, you will find yourself in a familiar world full of new life, harder challenges and lots of amazing blocks to expand your creativity. 

If you are bored of vanilla, but don't wish to get yourself into massive modpacks quite yet, and Vanilla+ doesn't cut it for you, then give Perfectly Splendid a try.

## 🔨 Installing the modpack

The pack is possible to install with any launcher, however, I can only fully support 3 methods: Vanilla Launcher; CurseForge app; Prism Launcher.

⚠ Warning ⚠ MultiMC users: at the time of writing this, MMC has a bug, that prevents Narrator Library from working, breaking text-to-speech blocks from Supplementaries. Otherwise, MultiMC is fully supported, but you will have to use something else to download the mods.

<details><summary>Using Prism Launcher (recommended):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install Prism Launcher https://prismlauncher.org/download/
2. Open Prism Launcher, right-click anywhere and choose "Create instance"
3. On the left side panel select "CurseForge", look up Perfectly Splendid and install it

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using CurseForge app (Windows only):</summary>
<p>

1. Download and install CurseForge app https://download.curseforge.com/
2. Open the app and let it find your Minecraft installation
3. Navigate to the Minecraft tab, select "Browse modpacks", search for Perfectly Splendid and install it

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Using vanilla launcher (not recommended):</summary>
<p>

1. Install the 1.19.2 version of the game and make sure it works without any mods
2. Navigate to https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/ and follow the instructions to install Quilt Loader 0.18.1-beta.68
3. Navigate to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl and download QSL, then put it into the .minecraft/mods folder. If such a folder doesn't exist, simply create one.
4. Navigate to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/perfectly-splendid, choose the latest version of the pack and scroll down until you see the list of included mods
5. Download every mod, make sure to use the correct versions, and put them all into the mods folder (some mods must be a specific version, to make the process easier find a way to download mods automatically using the pack's zip, rather than manually)
6. Download the modpack file and extract the "config", "shaderpacks" and "kubejs" folders from it, put them all in .minecraft/
7. Launch the game using the Quilt profile in the launcher

<details><summary>Recommended JVM arguments</summary>
<p>

Using the recommended flags is not necessary, but it might significantly boost your performance, when generating new chunks and running garbage collection.

The pack was tested on default Java installations shipped with vanilla launcher and CF app, as well as Adoptium JDK 17 and 19.

The pack was tested with default Java arguments provided by vanilla launcher and CF app.

<p> Absolute maximum required allocated memory for the pack is 12GB </p>

### ⚠ Known issues

<details><summary>First ever launch "crashes" with an "internal error" message.</summary>

  **Status**: ❌ Reported. Not fixed.

  **Severity**: Low. 

  **Workarounds**: Simply launch the game again. I think this is due to JumpQuilt technically being run on Forge to download Quilt. You don't need to report this to Quilt, as it says.

  **Status**: ❌ Reported. Not fixed.
