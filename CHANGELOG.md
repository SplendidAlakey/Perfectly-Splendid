<h1 align="center"> Perfectly Splendid Update 1 <br>

#### Note: if updating from v0.1, delete Towns and Towers from .minecraft/config/paxi/datapacks.

#### If you would like for the new resosurce packs to apply automatically, delete your options.txt. Otherwise, add it manually in video settings.

### Changes:

- Aurora's Decorations blocks are now craftable, using Charm's woodcutter.
- Added mod compatibility between Charm and all other modded wood types.
- Fixed bees not entering hives (beeDupeFix rule removed).
- Allowed for some mobs from Wondrous Wilds to be captured in Supplementaries' jars.
- Disabled fireflies from Naturalist (Wondrous Wilds already adds fireflies).
- Fixed an error, resulting in the Ender Dragon having x4 HP (**intended:** x2 HP).
- Fixed modded bows and crossbows visually not having any projectiles (removed **By Design** mod).
- Allowed some Mythic Mounts to spawn in BetterNether and Promenade biomes.
- Drastically reduced the chances for a Mythic Mount to spawn (the most common is 40, the least common is 1).
- Reworked bundle crafting recipes. To craft a bundle, simply form a bucket shape with wool. Each colour works. "Vanilla" recipe has been removed, use rainbow wool to craft it ;)
- Allowed using coloured bundles with upgrade tokens.
- Made it so that villagers always convert to zombies, regardless of the difficulty setting, in case you aren't playing on Hard.
- Removed duplicate bamboo recipes from Twigs, sorry for that!
- Added compatibility between Bamboo Everything, Twigs and Blockus.
- Removed duplicate crimson and warped chests/barrels.
- Unified chests and barrels with appropriate tags.
- Made almost all recipes, that use chests, utilize tags, if they didn't before. This means modded chests will work with almost all recipes now.
- The One Probe will no longer give players a note at spawn. If you've already got one, you'll keep it. And you will still be able to craft it, if need be.
- Fixed Visual Traveler's Titles resource pack not applying when first installing the pack or resetting options.txt.
- Removed Supplementaries' wrench, use Create's one. Also hid Additional Additions' wrench from REI (the recipe was already disabled).
- Hid Supplementaries' blackboard from REI (the recipe was already disabled, use Aurora's Decorations' boards).
- Removed Towns and Towers datapack. There's now a config file with the same exact values.
- Nerfed Sai (**old:** 2 positive DMG, 0 negative DMG; **new:** 0 positive DMG, 1 negative DMG).
- Farmer's Delight knives no longer inherit BetterCombat systems.
- Slightly change IPN integration hints (some inventories will use player inventory only buttons, instead of none at all).
- Added missing translation strings for Supplementaries item groups.
- Fixed Player Plates translation strings for item groups.
- Fixed a typo in rei_integrations script, that resulted in some items not getting hidden.
- Significantly reduced chances of skeletons carrying quivers (**old:** 20%; new: 5%).
- Slightly buffed stats, that looted gear gets in the Nether (**old:** x1.2 AP, +2 HP, x1.3-1.5 DMG, x1.3-1.5 PDMG; **new:** x1.2-2.0 AP, +1.5-2.0 HP, x1.3-1.6 DMG, x1.3-1.7 PDMG).
- Slightly rebalanced all Nether enemies (**old:** +2 AP, x1.4-1.5 HP, x2 XP; **new:** +1.5-2.0 AP, x1.5-2.0 HP, x2.5 XP).
- Buffed all enemies in the End (**old:** vanilla values; **new:** x2.0-3.0 HP, +2-5 AP).
- Buffed stats, that looted gear gets in the End (**old:** x1.5 AP, +4 HP, x1.8-2.0 DMG, x1.8-2.0 PDMG; **new:** x1.5-2.0 AP, +4-5 HP, x1.5-3.0 DMG, x2.0-3.0 PDMG).
- Gave a tiny buff to all looted weapons' stats across all dimensions (**old:** x1.1 DMG, x1.1 PDMG for rares, x1.2 DMG, x1.2 PDMG for epics; **new:** x1.1-1.15 DMG, x1.1-1.15 PDMG for rares, x1.2-1.35 DMG, x1.2-1.35 PDMG for epics).
