<h1 align="center"> Perfectly Splendid Update 1 (unreleased) <br>

#### If you would like for the new resosurce packs to apply automatically, delete your options.txt. Otherwise, add it manually in video settings.

### Changes:

- Significantly reduced chances of skeletons carrying quivers (**old:** 20%; new: 5%).
- Fixed an error, resulting in the Ender Dragon having x4 HP (**intended:** x2 HP).
- Slightly buffed stats, that looted gear gets in the Nether (**old:** x1.2 AP, +2 HP, x1.3-1.5 DMG, x1.3-1.5 PDMG; **new:** x1.2-2.0 AP, +1.5-2.0 HP, x1.3-1.6 DMG, x1.3-1.7 PDMG).
- Slightly rebalanced all Nether enemies (**old:** +2 AP, x1.4-1.5 HP, x2 XP; **new:** +1.5-2.0 AP, x1.5-2.0 HP, x2.5 XP).
- Buffed all enemies in the End (**old:** vanilla values; **new:** x2.0-3.0 HP, +2-5 AP).
- Buffed stats, that looted gear gets in the End (**old:** x1.5 AP, +4 HP, x1.8-2.0 DMG, x1.8-2.0 PDMG; **new:** x1.5-2.0 AP, +4-5 HP, x1.5-3.0 DMG, x2.0-3.0 PDMG).
- Gave a tiny buff to all looted weapons' stats across all dimensions (**old:** x1.1 DMG, x1.1 PDMG for rares, x1.2 DMG, x1.2 PDMG for epics; **new:** x1.1-1.15 DMG, x1.1-1.15 PDMG for rares, x1.2-1.35 DMG, x1.2-1.35 PDMG for epics).
- Fixed modded bows and crossbows visually not having any projectiles (removed **By Design** mod).
- Allowed some Mythic Mounts to spawn in BetterNether and Promenade biomes.
- Reworked bundle crafting recipes. To craft a bundle, simply form a bucket shape with wool. Each colour works. "Vanilla" recipe has been removed, as there's a brown bundle already.
- Allowed using coloured bundles with upgrade tokens.
- Made it so that villagers always convert to zombies, regardless of the difficulty setting, in case you aren't playing on Hard.
- Removed duplicate bamboo recipes from Twigs, sorry for that!
- Added compatibility between Bamboo Everything, Twigs and Blockus.
- Removed duplicate crimson and warped chests/barrels.
- Unified chests and barrels with appropriate tags.
- Made almost all recipes, that use chests, utilize tags, if they didn't before. This means modded chests will work with almost all recipes now.
- The One Probe will no longer give players a note at spawn. If you've already got one, you'll keep it. And you will still be able to craft it, if need be.
- Fixed Visual Traveler's Titles resource pack not applying when first installing the pack or resetting options.txt.

- Animated Colored Axolotls.
